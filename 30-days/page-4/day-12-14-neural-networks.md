# Day 12-14: Neural Networks

Here are detailed notes for **Day 12-14: Neural Networks** from your Week 2 schedule:

***

#### **Neural Networks Overview**

* **Definition**: A **Neural Network (NN)** is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of layers of connected neurons (nodes) that transform input data into outputs by learning complex patterns.
* **Key Application Areas**: Neural networks are widely used in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting.

#### **1. Basics of Neural Networks**

**1.1 Structure of a Neural Network**

* **Neuron (Node)**: The fundamental unit of a neural network. It performs a weighted sum of the inputs, adds a bias term, and applies an activation function.
* **Layers**:
  * **Input Layer**: The first layer that receives the input features.
  * **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that apply transformations to the input data. The more hidden layers, the deeper the network.
  * **Output Layer**: The last layer that produces the final prediction or classification.
* **Weights**: Each connection between neurons has a weight, which represents the strength of the connection.
* **Bias**: A constant added to the weighted sum before applying the activation function, allowing the model to better fit the data.
* **Activation Function**: Determines whether the neuron should activate and pass its signal to the next layer. Common activation functions include:
  * **Sigmoid**: ( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x\}} ) (used in binary classification).
  * **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: ( f(x) = \max(0, x) ) (most common in hidden layers).
  * **Tanh**: ( f(x) = \tanh(x) ) (scales output between -1 and 1).

**1.2 Forward Propagation**

* **Goal**: Pass the input data through the network layer by layer to compute the output.
* **Process**:
  1. Multiply the input by the weights, add the bias, and pass the result through the activation function.
  2. Repeat for each layer, passing the output of one layer as the input to the next.
  3. The final output is the prediction.

**1.3 Loss Function**

* **Purpose**: Quantifies how far the network's predictions are from the actual labels.
* **Common Loss Functions**:
  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Used for regression problems.
  * **Binary Cross-Entropy**: Used for binary classification.
  * **Categorical Cross-Entropy**: Used for multi-class classification.

#### **2. Backpropagation and Training**

**2.1 Backpropagation**

* **Goal**: Minimize the loss by adjusting the weights and biases in the network.
* **How It Works**:
  1. **Calculate Loss**: Compute the difference between the predicted output and the actual target.
  2. **Gradient Calculation**: Use the chain rule of calculus to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to each weight.
  3. **Update Weights**: Adjust the weights in the direction that reduces the loss (gradient descent).
  4. **Repeat**: Perform forward and backward passes multiple times (epochs) until the loss converges or the model reaches a stopping criterion.

**2.2 Gradient Descent**

* **Concept**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss by updating the weights in the direction of the steepest descent (negative gradient).
* **Learning Rate**: A hyperparameter that controls the size of the weight updates. A small learning rate may lead to slow convergence, while a large learning rate may cause overshooting.
* **Types of Gradient Descent**:
  * **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses the entire dataset to compute gradients (slow but accurate).
  * **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Uses a single training sample to compute gradients (faster but noisier).
  * **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses small batches of data to compute gradients (a balance between speed and accuracy).

**2.3 Regularization Techniques**

* **Purpose**: Prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights or adding noise to the model.
* **Common Techniques**:
  * **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Adds a penalty proportional to the square of the weights (keeps weights small).
  * **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights (can lead to sparse models).
  * **Dropout**: Randomly drops some neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.

#### **3. Introduction to Deep Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow and PyTorch)**

Deep learning frameworks simplify the process of building, training, and deploying neural networks.

**3.1 TensorFlow**

**Overview:**

* **TensorFlow** is a popular open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It provides an extensive library for building and training neural networks.
* **Key Features**:
  * Supports both **low-level operations** (manual control over tensors, gradients) and **high-level APIs** (Keras, for rapid prototyping).
  * Supports **distributed training** across multiple devices (GPUs, TPUs).
  * Provides a **TensorBoard** tool for visualizing model training (loss, accuracy, etc.).

**Key Components:**

* **Tensors**: Multi-dimensional arrays, the basic data structure in TensorFlow.
* **Keras API**: A high-level API built into TensorFlow for building and training models quickly. Example of a simple model using Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Build a simple Sequential model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer for 10-class classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

**Advantages of TensorFlow:**

* Widely adopted in both industry and academia.
* Extensive support for **deployment** on mobile and embedded devices (TensorFlow Lite).
* Large community and numerous pre-trained models available in **TensorFlow Hub**.

**3.2 PyTorch**

**Overview:**

* **PyTorch** is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook. It is known for its flexibility and dynamic computation graph, which makes it intuitive for research and experimentation.
* **Key Features**:
  * **Dynamic Computation Graph**: Unlike TensorFlow’s static graph, PyTorch builds the computation graph dynamically, making it more intuitive for debugging.
  * **Autograd**: PyTorch’s automatic differentiation library, which tracks all operations on tensors and automatically computes gradients during backpropagation.
  * Strong support for **GPU acceleration** with minimal code changes.

**Key Components:**

* **Tensors**: Similar to NumPy arrays, but can run on GPUs for acceleration.
* **nn.Module**: The base class for all neural network modules. Example of a simple model in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple feedforward neural network
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 128)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = SimpleNN()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for data, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

**Advantages of PyTorch:**

* Easier to experiment and debug due to its dynamic nature.
* Favored by researchers for rapid prototyping and flexibility.
* Strong ecosystem for computer vision (TorchVision), natural language processing (TorchText), and reinforcement learning (TorchRL).
