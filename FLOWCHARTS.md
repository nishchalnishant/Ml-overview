# ML Overview — Topic Flowcharts for Recall

> One flowchart per topic area. Each node = concept. Arrow = "leads to" or "causes" or "is part of".
> Use for: daily 5-min recall drills, pre-study revision, interview prep.

---

## HOW TO USE THESE FLOWCHARTS

```
Before reading a topic  →  glance at its flowchart  →  predict the structure
After reading a topic   →  close the file            →  redraw from memory
Before an interview     →  only redraw, don't read   →  if you can draw it, you can explain it
```

## PART 1 — FOUNDATIONS

### 1.1 AI/ML Taxonomy

```
AI
├── Narrow AI → task-specific, no generalization across domains
├── AGI → general reasoning across domains, no specialized training
├── Symbolic AI → logic rules, explicit knowledge, brittle to noise
└── Sub-symbolic AI → learned representations, data-driven, tolerant to noise
    │
    └── ML
        ├── Supervised → labeled input-output pairs → minimize empirical loss
        ├── Unsupervised → structure from unlabeled data → density, clusters, latents
        ├── Semi-supervised → few labels + many unlabeled → pseudo-labeling or consistency
        ├── Self-supervised → labels from data itself → MAE, BERT, contrastive pretraining
        └── Reinforcement Learning → reward signal, policy → no i.i.d. assumption
            │
            └── Deep Learning → multi-layer representations → end-to-end gradient flow
                │
                └── LLMs → transformer + massive pretraining → emergent capabilities
                    ├── GPT family → autoregressive, decoder-only → next-token loss
                    ├── BERT family → masked LM, encoder-only → bidirectional context
                    └── T5/Seq2Seq → encoder-decoder, text-to-text → unified format

No Free Lunch Theorem
└── no universally best algorithm → must match model to domain → inductive bias matters

Bias-Variance Tradeoff
├── High Bias → underfitting, model too simple → cannot capture true function
├── High Variance → overfitting, memorizes training noise → poor generalization
└── Sweet Spot → low bias + low variance → generalization
    ├── Underfitting signals → high train + test error → increase model capacity
    └── Overfitting signals → low train, high test error → regularize or get more data
```

│   ├── KNN imputation → fill with weighted neighbor values → preserves local feature structure
│   └── MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) → iterative multivariate regression per
│       feature → gold standard → captures inter-feature dependencies, handles MCAR/MAR
│
├── Feature Scaling
│   ├── StandardScaler → zero mean, unit variance → z = (x - μ)/σ → assumes Gaussian-like
│   ├── MinMaxScaler → bounds features to [0,1] → x' = (x-min)/(max-min) → sensitive to outliers
│   └── RobustScaler → median/IQR centering → x' = (x-median)/IQR → outlier-resistant
│
├── Categorical Encoding
│   ├── One-hot encoding → sparse binary columns, no ordinal assumption → high cardinality → curse
│   ├── Label encoding → ordinal integers → only valid for truly ordered categories

```
Deep Learning Building Blocks

│   └── Zero init → anti-pattern → symmetry never breaks → all neurons learn same thing
│
├── Normalization Layers
│   ├── BatchNorm
│   │   ├── normalize over batch dimension → μ,σ from current mini-batch
│   │   └── train ≠ eval → uses running stats at inference → BN fails with small batches
│   ├── LayerNorm

│   └── Schedule-Free → no LR schedule needed, online averaging → Primal averaging trick
│
├── Gradient Management
│   ├── Gradient clipping → clip by norm → prevents RNN explosion → g ← g·clip_val/‖g‖
│   └── Gradient accumulation → simulate large batch, low memory → avg over N micro-batches
│
├── Regularization Techniques

│
├── Backward Pass
│   ├── chain rule → ∂L/∂w = ∂L/∂a · ∂a/∂z · ∂z/∂w → product of local Jacobians
│   ├── accumulate gradients per parameter → sum across batch
│   └── optimizer → update weights via gradient step → w ← w - η·∂L/∂w
│
├── Vanishing Gradient
│   ├── cause → tanh/sigmoid saturate, small derivatives chain → product < 1 collapses
│   └── fix → ReLU activations + residual connections → gradient highway around layers
│
├── Exploding Gradient
│   ├── cause → deep RNNs multiply large Jacobians → product > 1 diverges
│   └── fix → gradient clipping by global norm → ‖g‖ > threshold → rescale
│
└── Residual Connections
    ├── output = F(x) + x → gradient highway through identity → ∂L/∂x = ∂L/∂(F+x) · (∂F/∂x + I)
    ├── enables very deep networks → ResNet / Transformers → 100+ layers viable

│   ├── concat + project → combine head outputs → W_O·concat(head₁,...,headₕ)
│   └── captures diverse relationship patterns → syntactic in one head, semantic in another
│
├── Cross-Attention

│   └── decoder attends to encoder representations → core of seq2seq translation
│
├── Efficient Attention Variants
│   ├── MQA (Multi-Query) → one K/V head, many Q heads → reduces KV cache by factor h
│   ├── GQA (Grouped-Query) → grouped K/V sharing → inference speedup → quality between MHA/MQA
│   └── FlashAttention
│       ├── tiled SRAM computation → avoids HBM roundtrips → IO-aware algorithm, not sparse
│       └── memory O(N) not O(N²) → longer context feasible → same exact output as standard
│
├── Sparse Attention Patterns
│   ├── Sparse Attention → attend only to subset of tokens → O(N√N) complexity
│   │   └── BigBird, Longformer → combine local + global + random attention patterns
│   └── Sliding Window Attention → each token attends to fixed local window w
│       ├── O(N·w) complexity → w ≪ N → used in Mistral
│       └── NOTE: distinct from FlashAttention — FlashAttention is IO-aware full attention impl
│
└── KV-Cache
    ├── store past K/V tensors → skip recomputation → linear memory growth with seq length
    ├── autoregressive inference speedup → each token cheaper → O(1) per step vs O(N)
    └── memory grows with sequence length → eviction strategies needed → sliding window eviction

```
Real-Time Model Serving (System Design)
│
├── Request Path
│   ├── Client → API Gateway/LB → Model Service → Response → p99 SLA governs every hop
│   ├── Feature fetch → online feature store (Redis/DynamoDB) → must match offline training features
│   └── Model inference → in-process (embedded) or RPC (gRPC/HTTP to model server) → RPC adds network hop
│
├── Sync vs Async Serving
│   ├── Sync (request-response) → user-facing, low-latency → recommendations, fraud, search ranking
│   └── Async (queue-based) → batch scoring, non-blocking → Kafka/SQS → consumer pool scores + writes result

│   └── vLLM / TGI (LLM-specific) → PagedAttention, continuous batching → built for autoregressive generation
│
├── Latency Budget Decomposition

│
└── Scaling the Service
    ├── horizontal pod autoscaling → CPU/QPS/custom metric (GPU util via Prometheus Adapter)

│
├── Feedback Loop
